# Realtime-Data-Streaming-of-Weather-API
Created an ETL pipeline. Data is extracted from WeatherAPI through Airflow, data is streamed in real-time using Apache Kafka for reliable and fault-tolerant message handling. Spark processes the data for transformations and analytics, enabling valuable real-time insights. The processed data is stored in HDFS for distributed and scalable storage.
